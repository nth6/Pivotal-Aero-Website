                <p class="long-copy">
                    Pivotal Aero is in the process of developing and prototyping a cutting edge wind turbine/solar skin structure called the M3 Hybrid, which will operate on a nano-grid / micro grid level with other hybrids. The M3 Hybrid combines a high-efficiency, compound annular wind turbine with mounted solar skin and single axis tracking capable of increasing power and energy density while maintaining durability and stability.  The innovative M3 Hybrid design provides secure energy generation by optimizing solar and wind power production depending on the climate conditions.

                        Utility and grid operators’ wholesale electricity purchase from carbon based power generation companies (coal and Natural Gas fired plants) are competitively priced with renewables. The goal is to implement the M3 into clusters in rural settings to provide an alternative source of power generation, thereby decreasing CO2 emissions, or target emerging countries with basic access to electricity. Retail electricity rates are rising nationally and vary state to state (.06 cents p/kWh - .$.40 cents p/kWh). Natural Gas prices are susceptible to volatile swings on the spot market for day ahead power delivery contracts. Attendant CO2 and CO2e emissions from carbon sources are also rising, unabated, and detrimental to the current and next generation of humans.

Based on data by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average U.S. residential home uses approximately 10,837 kWh in electricity consumption per year, amounting to 14 lbs. of CO2 pollution. Non-renewable electricity generation is harmful to the environment and is the third largest source of household CO2 waste. With the increasing efficiency of renewable energy including advancements in photovoltaic technology and wind turbine design, clean energy generation can economically match the retail cost of large utility energy generation on a nano-grid level.

For years, the centralized power grid has successfully delivered electricity to billions. Because centralized power is so large and interconnected, it is susceptible to physical and cyberattacks. In August 2003, 50 million people lost electricity as a result of a malfunctioning power line in Cleveland, which is to this day, the largest blackout in U.S. history. Worldwide, regulators, policymakers, and investors are searching for cleaner, more stable energy solutions. Nano and micro-grid power (~10kW – 100 kW) remedies this problem delivering competitively priced electricity costs arising from the declining cost of energy storage solutions and from the increased efficiency of renewable energy. Additionally, lithium-ion battery costs have fallen by 40% since 2010, solar panels are 80% cheaper than they were in 2009, and wind turbine prices have dropped up to 35% since 2008. Combined, Pivotal Aero can position itself appropriately to enter this emerging market at a time when we can substantially revolutionize the small-scale energy sector.

                <h4>the M3 hybrid</h4>
                <p class="long-copy">
                    The  M3 Hybrid is a standalone wind turbine designed to be deployed in a distributed generation (DG) nano/microgrid setting (10kW to 100kW rating). The technology combines a high-efficiency, compound ducted turbine with mounted bendable photovoltaic solar skin (SolarSkin). This design has been tested to increase the power density and capacity factor compared to similarly-sized structures. <br> <br>
                    
                    Traditionally, solar panels have dominated the microgrid industry. Solar alone can only produce electricity during daylight hours, and therefore must either be tied to the grid, be coupled with a backup generator or other energy sources, or be connected to a large battery bank. This is largely inefficient and costly. The M3 Hybrid uniquely solves this problem by harvesting both solar and wind power simultaneously over a 24-hour period with a total 2.0 kilowatt (kW) power rating, thus mitigating the intermittency of merely using solar power. The M3 Hybrid is designed to provide energy during the day and night – solar will be the primary electricity producer during the day and winter months, and wind will be the primary producer at night and summer months.

                <h4>Turbine</h4>
            <p class="long-copy more">The M3 Hybrid consists of a compound, dual annulus/annular wing, counter rotating propeller blades, dual rotor/turbine system, consisting of variable and/or fixed vanes on the inner walls, horizontal and vertical stabilizers connecting the forward and after ducts, and vortex generators for flow attachment along the inner/outer duct walls circumferentially arranged for efficient harvesting of wind energy. The performance of rotors/propellers/fans within a shroud or duct improve turbine efficiency by minimizing losses at the rotor/propeller tip, provided suitable clearance between the propeller tip and shroud are met in these axial flow systems. Ducted propellers/ducted fans provide high static thrust per rotor diameter than an un-ducted propeller. Un-ducted, mono-propeller Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) turbines deflect away a significant portion of the incoming free-stream resulting in lower turbine efficiency and power production and vortex shedding also creates turbulence at the blade tip. As well, flow efficiencies are also lost in un-ducted, mono-propeller systems as wind flow passes through the propeller in these axial flow systems. The energy in the wind that is lost due to deflection, tip clearance, vortex shedding, and flow through the propellers cannot be recovered and extracted in conventional un-ducted, mono-propeller systems.
<br/><br/>
Patented M3 Hybrid compound ducted design provides higher efficiency in wind extraction based on coefficient of performance derived from Lanchester-Betz-Joukowski limit. The M3 Hybrid takes a multidisciplinary approach to the design configuration, integrating ducted fan technology (aviation-aerodynamics), specifically the use of a positive cambered duct (airfoil geometry), vortex generators, internal duct heating to prevent ice formation, fixed and variable stator vane(s) and nacelle to augment, streamline and disrupt fluid flow in ducted fan/ducted wind turbine systems. SolarSkin rests atop the annular wings to increase power density without significantly altering the design of the turbine.
<br/><br/>
Lanchester-Betz-Joukowski law limits the maximum energy conversion efficiency of 59.23% when the axial wind speed is reduced by ⅔ across a single rotor disc. However, practical wind turbines convert significantly less than 40% of the power available in the wind per rotor sweep area into electrical energy. Hence, nearly 60% of the potential wind power per rotor swept area escapes without being harnessed. The primary reason may be that a single rotor cannot be designed to achieve large changes in velocity or enthalpy. However, a compound turbine system provides more rotor sweep area than a single, mono-propeller system of the same diameter. The power output of a wind turbine is directly related to the swept area of its blades. The larger the diameter of its blades, the more power it is capable of extracting from the wind. Power captured by the rotor is linear. If the swept area is doubled as in the M3 Hybrid, then so to be the amount of energy it can capture.
<br/><br/>
The M3 Hybrid is designed to maximize the flow field along the inner duct wall and also at the outer duct walls for the benefit of streamlining flow through the duct (maintain flow attachment) and to direct high velocity flow to the after turbine tips to begin rotation, as well as maintain a low pressure area downstream of the forward propeller.
<br/><br/>
Free-stream wind flow approaching the embodiment in practical operation is often turbulent flow. Unsteady aerodynamics in the form of wind shear, rapidly shift cross-wind, gusting winds, and gale force wind is a cause of flow separation common to ducted/shrouded/diffuser turbines.
<br/><br/>
Vortex generators are commonly used in aviation, situated along the leading edge as a percentage to chord to delay flow separation. Flow separation can be a potential problem in ducted as well as un-ducted wind turbine systems. Vortex generators delay flow separation. Vortex generators are positioned in the annulus leading edge annular wing and are affixed in such a way that they have an angle of attack (a.o.a.) with respect to the local airflow. In addition, the use of vortex generators augments the stream wise vorticity within a separating boundary layer, increasing the fluid momentum near the surface and thus delaying separation.
<br/><br/>
Capacity factor sharply increases to a range of 45-60% where wind and solar resources overlap with the distributed generation load center.  The estimated levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the M3 Hybrid in Class 4-6 wind sites is .08 cents/kWh (before subsidies). The M3 Hybrid varies in diameter from 10’ (ft.) to 26’ (ft.) for combined systems up to 10kW, based on local wind and solar resources.
<br/><br/>
The LCOE drops further to .058 cents p/kWh (before subsidies) for 100KW rated combined system at approximately 50’ (ft.) in diameter.  This is a combined wind and solar capacity factor and combined systems LCOE estimate.  At a distributed generation level for nano and micro grids, the M3 Hybrid can effectively compete against carbon retail electricity from utilities and grid operators, through a utility – connected nano grid (UNG) or utility-connected micro-grid (UMG).
<br/><br/>
Not all roofs are eligible due to location and structural load to support rooftop solar arrays for distributed generation. Pivotal Aero is developing the M3 Hybrid to withstand hurricane force gusts of up to 160mph to ensure “peace of mind” to the nano and micro grid customers and ease of permitting.  Inclusion of storage as a follow on, but non-proprietary technology, allows the nano and micro grid to store excess capacity during off peak demand for later consumption of electricity, emergency power management, and potentially for heating. Powering the nano and micro grids with the M3 Hybrid requires no infrastructure investment in transmission and distribution, such as High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) lines.  Further, since nano and micro grids have pre-existing transmission lines and lower load demand, less strain or “power bottlenecking” is placed on the existing grid infrastructure.</p>

                <h4>Solar Skin</h4>
            <p class="long-copy more">The SolarSkin is composed of thin film monocrystalline cells that are extremely lightweight and flexible enough to be mounted on a curved and contoured surface area. The SolarSkin (manufactured by SunPower) is designed for maximal energy extraction. It is mounted atop the annular wings (shown in blue) with a 1.1 kW power rating and is designed to self-align at optimal sun exposure. The SolarSkin configuration consists of nine 100 W solar panels and two 50 W solar panels each with a 17.8 volt (V) nominal rating. The first stage of SolarSkin consists of two configurations of one 50 W and one 100 W panels each wired in parallel. The second stage of SolarSkin consists of two configurations of four 100 W panels also wired in parallel, and these will be connected to a battery bank for backup storage in the event that solar and wind generation do not align to meet spikes in demand or peak loads. The SolarSkin self-aligns with maximum solar insolation using actuators linked to proactive monitoring tools (Internet of Things – IoT) that track the sun’s position throughout the day. Pivotal Aero’s single axis solar tracking technology orients the panels to minimize the angle of incidence between sunlight and the SolarSkin to maximize power generation: panels that track the sun can receive up to 10% (in winter) and 40% (in the summer) more energy than fixed panels. Manual automation of the SolarSkin can also be used to induce tilt to remove snow or debris that may drastically reduce performance. An algorithm would control this feature in addition to turbine diagnostics so that the M3 Hybrid operates autonomously. Internet enabled forecasting (IoT) will also download wind and weather forecasts to enable safe tracking and retraction of the SolarSkin.</p>
